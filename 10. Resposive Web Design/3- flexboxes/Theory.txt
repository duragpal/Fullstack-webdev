display: flex;
arrange items one along with another..
'''main axis = horizontal 
'''cross axis = vertical
we can position all child elements by applying properties to parent element.

Along main axis:
justify-content: <center,flex-start,flex-end,space-between,space-evenly,space-around>

along cross axis:
align-item:by default it is stretch
align-item has same attributes as justify-content.
<flex-start , flex-end , center>
align-content: croos axis.


==========
flex-wrap: wrap   <it will wrap elemenets when space is not available>
=======================
flex-direction: row , column ....bydefult it is row
column, == it turns the flex-box by 90.. main and cross axis interchange.

==========================================
Properties to flex box:
1) flex-shrink: 0 //it will not shrink that box; by default it is 1..
2) flex-grow:1  it will give left space of box assigned
   box1: flexgrow = 2  it is 2/5 part to box1
    box2: flexgrow = 3  it gives 3/5 part to box1;
3) flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>;
4) align-self: flex-start  //// applied to each div... can be different for each div..  //cross axis
using self property only on cross axis.
